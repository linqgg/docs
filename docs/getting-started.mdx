# Getting Started

:::warning
The full implementation and description of the API Reference is still in progress and requires some work on our part, but there are no plans to change the method signatures.
:::

## Access to services

Production and stage environments are available for connection; to start integration, you should use the data for stage.

To gain access to the environment, a special token is required, which is generated upon request. It is used for the initial connection between services, then authorization occurs through user tokens.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="stage" label="Stage" default>
    ```
      services-stage-mx6hvkth4a-uc.a.run.app
      services.stage.galactica.games
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Production" label="Production" default>
    ```
      services.galactica.games
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Install dependencies

This tutorial provides integration examples for NodeJS and TypeScript.

To get started, install the [@protobuf-ts/grpc-transport](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@protobuf-ts/grpc-transport) and [@grpc/grpc-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@grpc/grpc-js)

```bash
# Install via NPM
npm install --save @grpc/grpc-js
npm install --save @protobuf-ts/grpc-transport
```

#### Transport and authorization

To work with gRPC, you need to create two auxiliary functions to create a container for sending commands to a remote service and for authorization. Optional, but improves usability.

```typescript
import { GrpcTransport } from "@protobuf-ts/grpc-transport";
import { RpcOptions } from "@protobuf-ts/runtime-rpc";
import { ChannelCredentials } from "@grpc/grpc-js";

export const getTransport = (): GrpcTransport => {
  const host = process.env.SERVICES_API_URL ?? "";
  return new GrpcTransport({
    host,
    channelCredentials: host.includes('localhost')
      ? ChannelCredentials.createInsecure()
      : ChannelCredentials.createSsl(),
  });
};

export const getAuthorization = (accessToken: string): RpcOptions => {
  return {
    meta: {
      authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`
    }
  };
};
```


:::info
Please note that this example uses the `SERVICES_API_URL` environment variable. If your name for this variable is different, you need to edit the example code to suit your needs.

## First request

As a test initial request, you can use a request to the location service by IP address. It does not require authorization.

To begin with, you should download the generated client for this service, unpack it and copy it to the `src/services` folder.

// link to file that can be downloaded
Client for location service

Below is an example of using a client to call the necessary methods on the service, in this case to obtain information about the current location and a flag that indicates whether access is allowed or not.

```typescript
// Import response type
import { Access } from "./services/system/v1alpha1/restrictions";
// Import service client for connecting to the backend
import { RestrictionsServiceClient } from "./services/system/v1alpha1/restrictions.client";
// Import special helpers for building transport and auth
import { getAuthorization, getTransport } from "./utils/transport";

export const accessChecker = async (): Promise<Access> => {
  // creates service instance using transport as a parameter
  const service = new RestrictionsServiceClient(getTransport());
  
  const access = await service.isAccessAllowed({});
  // in case authorization needed, use the next way of doing request
  // auth token - token, which backend gives for user oprations
  // const access = await service.isAccessAllowed({}, getAuthorization('auth token'));

  return access.response;
}

accessChecker().then((access: Access) => {
  console.log(access);
  // will return similar to
  // { allowed: true, location: { country: 'US', region: 'CA', city: 'Palo Alto' } }
});
```


An example application for checking a location is attached below as an archive.
